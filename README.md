9-Axis accelerometer data recording of Cambridge to Cambridge UK Royal Mail first class letter

Sampling speed for accerlermeter/magnetometer at 50Hz/s
Temperature and humidity sampling speed 1Hz/s

Python is used to generate plots for data.

14:45 - 15:01 Walking to post office, the rest is the record when the letter is in the post office and deliver network. I received the letter around 13.00 next day, data logger flat bettery at around 10:00, but still many useful data obtained for studying.

Cheers,
